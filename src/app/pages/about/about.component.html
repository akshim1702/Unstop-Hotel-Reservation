            <li><strong>Floors 1-9:</strong> Each floor has 10 rooms (e.g., Floor 1: 101-110, Floor 2: 201-210).</li>

        <h2>Room Proximity & Travel Time</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Horizontal Travel:</strong> 1 minute per room when moving between adjacent rooms on the same floor.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Booking Rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A guest can book up to <span class="highlight">5 rooms</span> at a time.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Priority:</span> The system books rooms on the same floor first if available.</li>
            <li>If the required rooms aren't available on one floor, the system minimizes travel time by choosing rooms across floors.</li>
            <li>When spanning floors, the system prioritizes the lowest combined vertical and horizontal travel time.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
        <p><strong>Available Rooms:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Floor 1: 101, 102, 105, 106</li>
            <li>Floor 2: 201, 202, 203, 210</li>
            <li>Floor 3: 301, 302</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Case 1:</strong> If a guest wants to book 4 rooms:</p>
        <p>The system selects <span class="highlight">101, 102, 105, and 106</span> on Floor 1 because it minimizes the travel time.</p>

        <p><strong>Case 2:</strong> If only 2 rooms are available on Floor 1:</p>
        <p>The system selects <span class="highlight">101, 102</span> from Floor 1 and <span class="highlight">201, 202</span> from Floor 2 to minimize vertical and horizontal travel time.</p>
